IMU and GPS Data Visualization with OpenGL

This project enables the visualization of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and GPS data using OpenGL. It establishes a serial communication link between the sensor module and the computer, allowing real-time data transfer and rendering the data in a 3D environment.

Features

Real-Time Data Visualization: Display the IMU and GPS data in a real-time 3D environment using OpenGL.
Serial Communication: Establish a serial communication link between the sensor module and the computer to receive data.
IMU Data Rendering: Render IMU data, including orientation (e.g., roll, pitch, and yaw) and acceleration, using appropriate OpenGL graphics techniques.
GPS Data Rendering: Visualize GPS data, such as latitude, longitude, and altitude, on the 3D scene.
Configurable Settings: Adjust various settings, such as rendering parameters, data sampling rates, and visualization styles.
Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

Hardware Setup: Connect the IMU and GPS sensor module to your computer via the serial port or a USB-to-serial adapter.
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as the OpenGL library and any required serial communication libraries.
Clone or Download: Clone the project repository or download the source code to your local machine.
Build Project: Build the project using the provided build system or compile the source code manually.
Configure Serial Communication: Set up the serial communication parameters in the code to match the settings of your sensor module.
Run the Application: Execute the compiled binary to start the application and visualize the IMU and GPS data in the OpenGL window.
